## Abstract

> In this section, give a summary of the entire report, what have you studied in the module, what you built, how did you show that you have learnt. Example:
>
> **(Intro)** The independent study delved into the topic of heap data structures and **(Learning Journey)** I started by gaining a solid understanding of linked lists, then moved on to stacks, queues, and finally heaps. To solidify understanding, I attempted programming challenges and built a **(Product)** hospital priority queue application using a heap. **(Main Key learning)** This project allowed me to understand the practicality of data structures in real-world scenarios and appreciate the benefits of using different data structures to represent a problem, thus making the study an enlightening experience that broadened my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Learning Journey

> In this section, describe what you wanted to learn and how you planned to learn them. In essence, summarize your CA1 into 3-4 paragraph here
>
> Example (Everything in this section is generated with ChatGPT):
>
>To enhance my understanding of data structures and algorithms, I took an online short course. The course provided a comprehensive introduction to the subject matter and helped me understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. I applied my knowledge by implementing the various data structures in Node.js, which gave me hands-on experience and helped me solidify my understanding of the concepts.
>
>After completing the course, I attempted to apply these data structures to real-world problems. I found various problems on Leetcode and Kattis, which provided me with an opportunity to try applying the algorithms I learned in the course. I repeated this process for each data structure, starting with linked lists, then moving on to stacks, queues, and finally heaps. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of each data structure and the best use cases for each one.
>
>One of the most interesting problems I encountered during my studies was the priority queue problem in a hospital setting. I studied the problem in depth and designed an algorithm to solve it. I then built a Command Line Interface (CLI) application to implement my solution. To make the application more user-friendly, I added various usability enhancements such as a clear and intuitive user interface. This project allowed me to understand the practicality of data structures and algorithms in real-world scenarios and helped me appreciate the benefits of using different data structures to represent a problem. 

## Product

> In this section, describe your end product and include instructions on how others may experience it. 
>
> Example:
>
> 1. To start the app: `npm start, you will be greeted with a prompt for the priority of people in queue
> 2. Enter the priority delimited by comma `1,43,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,5,44,3,2,42,3,4,3,2,222,3,3,42,1`. (1 - higher priority, 9999 - lowest priority)
> 3. The program will provide 3 possible command 1 - Add to queue, 2 - Get next in queue
> 4. You can try to .....
> 5. You will see ......
> 6. etc...

> **(Point)** In this study, I learned about the importance of representing problems using different data structures. **(Example)** Through the priority queue project, I came to understand that a problem that may initially seem like it requires a queue, might actually be better modelled using a heap. **(Elaborate)** This deeper understanding of data structures has helped me to approach problem-solving with a more analytical mindset and to make better decisions when it comes to selecting the right data structure for a particular problem.
